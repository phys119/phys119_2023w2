We have access to tools to measure the voltage $V$ (using a voltmeter) across the resistor as well as the current $I$ (using an ammeter) in the circuit.

We have done so below for a mock dataset of voltages and currents. It is worth noting that this issue is one of great general interest in science. We may have two variables which are related---in this case the current $I$ through the resistor as a result of the voltage of the potential across the resistor $V_R$) and a model that describes how they may be related (here, Ohm's law). What we can do as experimental scientists is to collect data of the two variables and try to fit a model to them; from this we may extract parameters of interest (here, the resistance of our circuit), as well as evaluate how good the model is at describing the phenomena we see.\n",
