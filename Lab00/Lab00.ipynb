    "The first thing we will introduce is the \"base unit\" of the Jupyter notebook, the \"cell.\" There are two types of cells; Code cells (where you can write and run Python code) and Markdown cells (where you can write text, and also create headings and equations). One benefit of using a Jupyter notebook for these labs is that you can seamlessly alternate between Markdown and Code cells. In a PHYS 119 lab session, we will generally have periods of notetaking when you are familiarizing yourself with the equipment for an experiment, coming up with a measurement plan, explaining your results and analysis, as well as planning and executing improvements. At other times, you will be using Python code to perform analysis and calculations on your data. A Jupyter notebook thus allows you to seamlessly transition between notetaking and analysis. Formatted text is entered in Markdown while the analysis will be done in a programming language called Python.\n",
