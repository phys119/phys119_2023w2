    "In Lab 08 you will continue to collect data from the RC circuit in an effort to improve your dataset. Additionally, this prelab will provide you with an analytic formula to help you automatically **calculate** the best fitting parameters to your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**An important reminder: the \"best fit\" is not the same as a \"good fit\".** Even though the analytic formula will give you the best fit of your model to your data, it does not allow you to say \"this is a *good* fit\". The best fit, by definition, is one that minimizes chi-squared, but a minimized chi-squared of $\\chi^2=11.8$ or one with a strong pattern in the residuals is still not considered a good fit to your data. Conversely, a minimized chi-squared of $\\chi^2=0.05$ still requires you to take a closer look at your uncertainty estimation strategy, since the uncertainties would likely be overestimated. This automated method of chi-squared minimization still requires you to use residuals plots and your other techniques for assessing goodness of fit."
